- 👋 Hi, I’m @MedjoPangit
- 👀 Good morning how are you?  I'm Dr. Worm- I’m interested in things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning.  It's a process.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to save the world.
- 📫 How to reach me ... telekenisis.  Yeah, that.

- But in all seriousness, I'm just an IT technician, primarily focused on network management, but I branch out in various
- derivatives, like PHP/HTML, Bash scripting, even electrical wiring.
